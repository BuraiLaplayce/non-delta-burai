#### 3 - Finally, open the game and waits for it starts to download the new cards
To see the new cards go to **Decks** and check the box **Alternate formats**.
#### 4 - Wants to play with friends?
The original serves doesn't allow you to play with custom cards. To do so I highly recommend to both players, that wants to play with these cards, install the mod and create a server using Hamachi, or any kind of programm like that, and join it. After that just **open the game** and go to **Lan + AI** create a room and wait your friend to join on it.
